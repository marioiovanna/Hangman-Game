### START 
To start the game just press any key on the keyborad. The screen will show you a random word to be guess, and then we need to start guessing those letters.
Some words contain SPACE ( _ ), so the space bar is part of the range.
The game is default with 20 lives, for press letters, and 5 total lifes to accert the words.
